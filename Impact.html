    <h1>Our Impact</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Smart Health Monitor</b> creates a direct impact on community health 
      and water safety by integrating technology and healthcare in a practical way.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved community awareness about water quality</li>
      <li>Reduced risk of waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea</li>
      <li>Empowering families to take preventive healthcare measures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time monitoring helps identify pollution sources quickly</li>
      <li>Promotes sustainable and safe water usage</li>
      <li>Supports government and NGOs in water management programs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Potential</h2>
    <p>
      With scalability, this system can be expanded to <b>rural villages, urban 
      communities, and even nationwide health monitoring</b>. It has the potential 
      to save lives and reduce the burden on healthcare systems by preventing 
      outbreaks before they spread.
